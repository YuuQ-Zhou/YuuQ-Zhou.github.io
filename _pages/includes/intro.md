# 👋 Welcome!
I am a senior at Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences, finishing my B.S. in Data Science and Big Data Technology under the guidance of Dr. Geng Zhu. I am passionate about leveraging data science to solve real-world healthcare challenges.

To bridge my computational skills with a commitment to human well-being, I proactively pursued micro-majors in "Health and Social Care" and "AI in Precision Medicine." These programs, covering topics from genetic diagnostics to chronic disease care, built a solid foundation for me to connect code with clinical applications.

I am currently translating theory into practice through a long-term internship at Wanda Information Co., Ltd., which is expected to continue until June 2026. Co-mentored by Professor Menghan Hu of East China Normal University, We are tackling a core, real-world industry challenge: how to effectively deploy state-of-the-art Large Language Models on vast and heterogeneous datasets to streamline complex workflows and enhance operational efficiency. This experience is providing me with deep insights into the complexities and immense potential of applying cutting-edge algorithms to diverse business scenarios.

Looking ahead to my Ph.D. studies, my research vision is clear and focused: **to develop human-centered and empathetic AI technologies for medicine**.

I aim to fuse multimodal data—such as medical imaging, physiological signals, clinical text, and genomics—with machine learning and deep learning algorithms to investigate underlying disease mechanisms and build more accurate diagnostic tools. I am particularly excited by the potential of combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create interactive platforms. These platforms would not only aid in diagnosis but also provide patients with dynamic guidance on rehabilitation, medication, and lifestyle interventions, serving as a trusted digital health companion. Beyond this, I am also keenly interested in exploring related frontiers such as **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), advanced prosthetics, AR/VR, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Robotics and multimodal generative models etc.**, and I am excited by the prospect of exploring their intersections in my future research.
