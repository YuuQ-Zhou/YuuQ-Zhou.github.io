# 👋 Welcome!
I am a senior at Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences, finishing my B.S. in Data Science and Big Data Technology under the guidance of Dr. Geng Zhu. I am passionate about leveraging data science to solve real-world healthcare challenges.

To bridge my computational skills with a commitment to human well-being, I proactively pursued micro-majors in "Health and Social Care" and "AI in Precision Medicine." These programs, covering topics from genetic diagnostics to chronic disease care, built a solid foundation for me to connect code with clinical applications.

I am currently translating theory into practice through a long-term internship at Wanda Information Co., Ltd., which is expected to continue until June 2026. Co-mentored by Professor Menghan Hu of East China Normal University, We are tackling a core, real-world industry challenge: how to effectively deploy state-of-the-art Large Language Models on vast and heterogeneous datasets to streamline complex workflows and enhance operational efficiency. This experience is providing me with deep insights into the complexities and immense potential of applying cutting-edge algorithms to diverse business scenarios.

Looking ahead to my Ph.D. studies, my research vision is clear and focused: **to develop human-centered and empathetic AI technologies for medicine**.

**Core Methodology**: I aim to fuse multimodal data—such as medical imaging, physiological signals, clinical text, and genomics—with machine learning and deep learning algorithms to investigate underlying disease mechanisms and build more accurate diagnostic tools.


**Application Focus**: I am particularly excited by the potential of combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create interactive platforms. These platforms would not only aid in diagnosis but also provide patients with dynamic guidance on rehabilitation, medication, and lifestyle interventions, serving as a trusted digital health companion.


**Ultimate Vision**: I am driven by the conviction that technology must bridge the gaps in healthcare accessibility and equity. My work aims to empower individuals, particularly those facing barriers within the traditional healthcare system. In the mental health domain, for instance, where specialists are scarce, geographically concentrated, and prohibitively expensive, many are deterred from seeking help. The interactive platform I envision is designed to address this: it would serve as a professional "first responder," providing users with an evidence-based preliminary self-assessment and intelligently guiding their next steps—suggesting when a clinical consultation is necessary, thereby optimizing limited medical resources and preventing delays in care.

Furthermore, this platform will be engineered as a safe, stigma-free space. For adolescents, young adults, and individuals with physical disabilities, it can combat misinformation by delivering reliable health education (e.g., on sexual health) and sharing authentic community experiences. This approach aims to reduce the shame that arises from a lack of knowledge and helps build a sense of social identity. My ultimate goal is to transform this platform from a mere tool into a trustworthy and empathetic digital health companion.

Beyond this, I am also keenly interested in exploring related frontiers such as advanced prosthetics, AR/VR, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and multimodal generative models, and I am excited by the prospect of exploring their intersections in my future research.
