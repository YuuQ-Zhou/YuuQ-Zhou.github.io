Decoding Schizophrenia: Superior Discriminative Power of Resting-State EEG over Event-related Potentials in a Comparative Machine Learning Framework

- FastSpeech is the first fully parallel end-to-end speech synthesis model.
- **EEG/ERP Data Preprocessing**: Systematically processed resting-state EEG and N-back task ERP signals using EEGLAB, implementing a full pipeline of filtering, artifact rejection, and normalization to maximize signal integrity and ensure high-quality data for analysis.
- **Frequency-Domain Biomarker Identification**: Employed Fourier Transform to extract power and energy spectrum features, converting complex time-series data into a clear frequency-domain representation to uncover potential biomarkers of schizophrenia.
- **Interpretable Machine Learning for Diagnosis**: Developed diagnostic models using interpretable algorithms (SVM, GBDT, KNN, Random Forest). Leveraged the Fisher-score algorithm for feature selection to pinpoint the most discriminative neural patterns across different frequency bands and brain regions.
- **Key Findings**: Demonstrated that GBDT model achieved superior performance in classifying resting-state EEG, while SVM was optimal for task-based ERP data. This highlights a state-dependent optimal model choice. Identified the occipital lobe during visual processing tasks as a critical region containing highly discriminative features, suggesting its key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
