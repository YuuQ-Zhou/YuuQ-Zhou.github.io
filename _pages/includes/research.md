**Decoding Schizophrenia: Superior Discriminative Power of Resting-State EEG over Event-related Potentials in a Comparative Machine Learning Framework**

This work establishes that for machine learning-based diagnosis, resting-state EEG provides a more powerful and reliable basis for classifying schizophrenia than brain activity recorded during cognitive tasks (ERPs).
